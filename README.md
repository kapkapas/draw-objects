# draw-objects

Update of original DrawObjects by by Angus Johnson ([http://www.angusj.com/](http://www.angusj.com/)) for latest versions of Delphi

[http://angusj.com/delphi/drawobject.html](http://angusj.com/delphi/drawobject.html)

##Usage
Add source folder to your library path.

##Example
A demo program is provided.

1. I strongly recommend you open the "a_demo_X.dob" tutorial files 
to get some idea of how the demo works and get an understanding of 
the basics of the TDrawObject components. (eg Several people have 
asked how to easily connect lines to other objects.)

2. I've included a number of other *.dob files to demonstrate the
range of possibilities for using these components.

3. This demo currently restricts text objects to single wrap-
around lines. This is simply a limitation of the demo (or more 
specifically the rather crude "Object Inspector").

Enjoy ...
